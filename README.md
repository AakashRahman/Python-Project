By compiling the national polling data from the past 3 Presidential Elections starting with 2008, we
can, with a high degree of accuracy & certainty, predict the winner in almost all 50 states. This can
be done consistently, within a +-5 point margin of error. We will convey these findings utilizing both
data analysis and visual representations. We will discuss the accuracy of pollsters on both a state
and national level. Historically, national polling is both less expensive and more accurate than its
statewide counterparts and our chosen data sets reflect that sentiment accordingly. Each of these
methods still plays an integral role in the overall prediction of election results.

With this in mind, we will also make a prediction regarding the 2020 election, deploying some of the
very same techniques used in prior polls in elections to announce our winner.
And our final prediction was 100 percent correct in the Presidential Election 2020.
Democratic Candidate won the Polls
